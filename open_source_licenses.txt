     notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices

     that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of

     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part

     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,

     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display

     generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party

     notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for

     informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You

     may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that

     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text

     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own

     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional

     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

     distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works

     as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the

     Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally

submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be

under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional

terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may

have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for

reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor

provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on

an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either

express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR

A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law

(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,

shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,

indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to

use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other

commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised

of the possibility of such damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may

choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,

indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with

this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and

hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims

asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such

warranty or additional liability.
